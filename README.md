# IMC-Prosperity2 (Island AlphaBravo)
Particpated in the challenge as an individual (not a good idea though). Final Ranking: 50rd worldwide, 3rd Hong Kong
The challenge was kind of long and thanks to some delay got longer so after 2nd Round as it was last week of my semester so couldn't give it enough time but still progressed alot.
The repo contain my final code for each of the 5 rounds with the corresponding log results too. I have also added data and the scripts which I used to analyse these data that I got from IMC.
