# IMC-Prosperity2 (island AlphaBravo)
Particpated in the challenge as an individual (not a good idea though). Final Ranking: 119th worldwide (out of 9,139), 6th Hong Kong
The challenge was kind of long and thanks to some delay got longer so after 2nd Round as it was last week of my semester so couldn't give it enough time but still progressed alot.
The repo contain my final code for each of the 5 rounds with the corresponding log results too. I have also added data and the scripts which I used to analyse these data that I got from IMC.
Here is a link to wiki of the challenge which contain the challenges for each of the round: https://imc-prosperity.notion.site/Prosperity-2-Wiki-fe650c0292ae4cdb94714a3f5aa74c85
