## Round 1
In this round, I used market making along the weighted average price for STARFRUIT and market making along 10K for AMETHYSTS in the algo challenge. For manual trading, I chose 956 and 985 bids, which were near optimal.

## Round 2
I used arbitrage and short selling for ORCHID, taking advantage of import tariffs. For manual trading, I found a high return sequence after testing. Overall, I jumped to the 39th position worldwide after this round.

## Round 3
This round involved using an ETF strategy for GIFT_BASKET, moving averages for CHOCOLATE, and Donchian Channels for ROSES. I couldn't find any viable strategy for STRAWBERRIES and also couldn't test much due to limited time. For manual task, I opened chests number 47X and 87X.

## Round 4
I used pair trading strategies for COCONUT and COCONUT_COUPON. For manual trading, I repeated the bids of 956 and 985.

## Round 5
Optimized previous strategies and chose not to trade COCONUT and CHOCOLATE. Due to time my unavailibilty, I didn't develop a new strategy using the latest information about traders. For manual trading, I used news to decide whether to short or long all the products. I achieved positive PnL on 6 out of 9 products.
